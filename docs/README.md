# TWC Archives Transcript Processor — Bundled App Project

This folder contains documentation for the next‑step project: a fully packaged macOS app where the runtime is self‑contained and user data lives outside the app bundle.

Docs in this folder are intentionally separate from any app code in `../app/`.

## Contents
- `SCOPING.md` — project scope, goals, non‑goals, decisions
- `REQUIREMENTS.md` — functional + non‑functional requirements
- `PIPELINE.md` — draft build + packaging pipeline
